Makes a video based on minimum inputs and user interaction

## Planned functionality
A text file (input)
-> a command line text-to-speech program (customizable, e.g. balabolka / balcon)
-> inputs the speech audio with a random image from an inputted or pre-set image directory
& converts the audio and image into a video with an editing program (customizable, e.g. ffmpeg)

## Spare ideas
1. Using recorded audio as the audio track instead of text
